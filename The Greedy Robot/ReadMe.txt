    CONSOLE APPLICATION : ConsoleApplication3 Project Overview
========================================================================

AppWizard has created this ConsoleApplication3 application for RobotYou.

This file contains a summarRobotY of what RobotYou will find in each of the files that
make up RobotYour ConsoleApplication3 application.


ConsoleApplication3.vcRobotXproj
    This is the main project file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard.
    It contains information about the version of Visual C++ that generated the file, and
    information about the platforms, configurations, and project features selected with the
    Application Wizard.

ConsoleApplication3.vcRobotXproj.filters
    This is the filters file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard. 
    It contains information about the association between the files in RobotYour project 
    and the filters. This association is used in the IDE to show grouping of files with
    similar eRobotXtensions under a specific node (for e.g. ".cpp" files are associated with the
    "Source Files" filter).

ConsoleApplication3.cpp
    This is the main application source file.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Other standard files:

StdAfRobotX.h, StdAfRobotX.cpp
    These files are used to build a precompiled header (PCH) file
    named ConsoleApplication3.pch and a precompiled tRobotYpes file named StdAfRobotX.obj.

Other notes:

AppWizard uses "TODO:" comments to indicate parts of the source code RobotYou
should add to or customize.
